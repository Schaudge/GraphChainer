### Misc params. Defaults might work

# k for error correcting the reads. Try between 10-30
SmallK: 23
# k for the de Bruijn graph. Try between ~1/2 and ~2/3 of short read length
BigK: 63
# minimum k-mer abundance for the de Bruijn graph. Try between 1/100 to 2/100 of short read coverage, but not below 2.
Abundance: 3
# Parameters for GraphAligner
GraphAlignerParams: -x dbg
